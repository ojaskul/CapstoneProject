        <p>Our group is trying to create a product that fulfills a niche in the market. Our group is primarily focusing on four different ideas which will be further narrowed down, which are: <br>
            automatic valve closer (for kitchen stoves etc.), gesture based wheelchair, automatic traffic management system, mini-weather station for extremely accurate data.</p>

                        <li>One problem that arose was that the current output from the digital IO pin wasn't nearly as high as was needed to make the motor spin.</li>
                        <li>Firstly, we attempted to use a MOSFET in a digital fashion (to supply current direclty from the power source) using the digital IO as the gate voltage.</li>
                        <li>This did not work, and we hypothesized it was due to the lack of current supplied by the batteies. After external consultation, we also tried to use the MOSFET in an analog fashion (amplify) which also did not work.</li>
                        <li>Our final attempt was to use an L298N motor driver and since our teams were also using these drivers for other classes, we had an immediate supply.</li>
                        <li>Through online tutorials, and datasheets for the L298N, the connections between the motor driver and ESP board were made and cross checked. Finally, a motor was conencted, which seemed to work</li>
                        <li>We added more controls on the landing page to control the DC motor, and throughly tested its functionality.</li>

                        <li>Using our experience from last time, our task today was to build a simple GUI to control the state of an LED. We had already gotten the application to connect to a hotspot.</li>
                        <li>We firstly identified all the appropriate GPIO pins that could be used for this purpose and checked their digital voltage and current levels.</li>
                        <li>After this, we hooked up a small LED through a current limiting resistor directly to ground, such that the digital write can directly control the state of the LED.</li>
                        <li>The GUI was developed as HTML which could be tentatively implemented as in-line functions in the ESP language. We decided to have On/Off buttons for this control.</li>
                        <li>We completed our primary prototype goal earlier than expected, and the next step was to control a motor. We ordered a 6V brushless DC motor that could be programmed similarly.</li>
