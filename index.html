     <ul>
      <li>We discussed which microcontroller we will be using for our prototype. We considered constraints such as time limits, parts sourcing, and ease of use.</li>
      <li>From all this, we landed on using a 32-bit ESP8266 MPU implemented on FEATHER MCU. This MCU has WiFi on board and has a small footprint so that it can be easily integrated with our demo</li>
      <li>The development environment for our prototypes were discussed, along with considerations of other peripherals such as power converters. etc.</li>
      <li>Our stretch goals for the prototype includes control of a small stepper motor. This stepper motor was selected and evaluated along with others.</li>
      <li>We finalized what was going to be implemented in our prototype (a terminal/simple UI to control, WiFi to send data, LED/motor as an end effector.</li>

    <td>
     <ul>
      <li>We finalized our initial project proposal documentation. Each of us had a task to do so this time we took time to read each others and fixed any mistakes that were observed.</li>
      <li>The sections for project tasks, resources, testing plans, and demo description were detailed more so our whole team could work on it together. We devised and revised these sections.</li>
      <li>A final proofread was also done by each team member independent of the others. Mistakes/improvements/clarifications were noted implemented accordingly.</li>

     <ul>
      <li>We discussed what needs to be done for the initial proposal document and which sections need expansion. </li>
      <li>We divided tasks to do over the week for each of us. Ojas is going to work on the discussion section, Isaac is going to work on the intro, background, and Garret will finish up the conclusion, and add to discussion</li>
      <li>We expanded on our project idea for all the peripherals, control systems, and subsystems we might need. </li>
      <li>We have also started to keep a very initial bill of materials that includes things each of us thinks we will need. So far we have major components such as MCUs, IO peripherals, etc.</li>

      <li>We finalized our project proposal to include everything we had presented in class. This includes the smart light switch, stove control, and weather system.</li>
      <li>We also included some hints about our WiFi based app in the proposal, e.g. what kind of connection would it use, how would it send the data (TCP/UDP).</li>
      <li>We also finalized external considerations and adding any additional stretch goals which are priority based: safety for stove controller, etc.</li>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>Our group is trying to create a product that fulfills a niche in the market. Our group is primarily focusing on four different ideas which will be further narrowed down, which are: <br>
automatic valve closer (for kitchen stoves etc.), gesture based wheelchair, automatic traffic management system, mini-weather station for extremely accurate data.</p>
