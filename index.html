     <ul>
      <li>We firstly created a schematic for our prototype including the motor and LED control.</li>
      <li>Using this experience, we developed our course of action for our final project and what changes can be made which will eventually make the product better.</li>
      <li>We discussed, and noted several components which would be of better fit and finalized the prototype demonstration document.</li>

    <td>Development of the motor driver controller, complete with simple UI and independent power supply</td>
    <td>
     <ul>
      <li>One problem that arose was that the current output from the digital IO pin wasn't nearly as high as was needed to make the motor spin.</li>
      <li>Firstly, we attempted to use a MOSFET in a digital fashion (to supply current direclty from the power source) using the digital IO as the gate voltage.</li>
      <li>This did not work, and we hypothesized it was due to the lack of current supplied by the batteies. After external consultation, we also tried to use the MOSFET in an analog fashion (amplify) which also did not work.</li>
      <li>Our final attempt was to use an L298N motor driver and since our teams were also using these drivers for other classes, we had an immediate supply.</li>
      <li>Through online tutorials, and datasheets for the L298N, the connections between the motor driver and ESP board were made and cross checked. Finally, a motor was conencted, which seemed to work</li>
      <li>We added more controls on the landing page to control the DC motor, and throughly tested its functionality.</li>

    <td>Development of the LED control functionality and stretch goal parts ordering</td>
    <td>
     <ul>
      <li>Using our experience from last time, our task today was to build a simple GUI to control the state of an LED. We had already gotten the application to connect to a hotspot.</li>
      <li>We firstly identified all the appropriate GPIO pins that could be used for this purpose and checked their digital voltage and current levels.</li>
      <li>After this, we hooked up a small LED through a current limiting resistor directly to ground, such that the digital write can directly control the state of the LED.</li>
      <li>The GUI was developed as HTML which could be tentatively implemented as in-line functions in the ESP language. We decided to have On/Off buttons for this control.</li>
      <li>We completed our primary prototype goal earlier than expected, and the next step was to control a motor. We ordered a 6V brushless DC motor that could be programmed similarly.</li>

     <ul>
      <li>As per last time, we received the parts we ordered which were primarily the ESP8266 MCU and a suitable battery.</li>
      <li>This day was all about reading documentation for the ESP module and understanding all the intricacies of WiFi based communication</li>
      <li>Firstly, we integrated a WiFi connection using online tutorials and the <a href="https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/0a-esp8266ex_datasheet_en.pdf">datasheet</a></li>
      <li>Finally, we made tentative designs for the GUI and roughly assessed the complexity of the prototype and final project.</li>

     <ul>
      <li>We discussed which microcontroller we will be using for our prototype. We considered constraints such as time limits, parts sourcing, and ease of use.</li>
      <li>From all this, we landed on using a 32-bit ESP8266 MPU implemented on FEATHER MCU. This MCU has WiFi on board and has a small footprint so that it can be easily integrated with our demo</li>
      <li>The development environment for our prototypes were discussed, along with considerations of other peripherals such as power converters. etc.</li>
      <li>Our stretch goals for the prototype includes control of a small stepper motor. This stepper motor was selected and evaluated along with others.</li>
      <li>We finalized what was going to be implemented in our prototype (a terminal/simple UI to control, WiFi to send data, LED/motor as an end effector.</li>

     <ul>
      <li>We finalized our initial project proposal documentation. Each of us had a task to do so this time we took time to read each others and fixed any mistakes that were observed.</li>
      <li>The sections for project tasks, resources, testing plans, and demo description were detailed more so our whole team could work on it together. We devised and revised these sections.</li>
      <li>A final proofread was also done by each team member independent of the others. Mistakes/improvements/clarifications were noted implemented accordingly.</li>

      <li>We expanded on our project idea for all the peripherals, control systems, and subsystems we might need. </li>
      <li>We have also started to keep a very initial bill of materials that includes things each of us thinks we will need. So far we have major components such as MCUs, IO peripherals, etc.</li>
