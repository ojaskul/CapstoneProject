# CapstoneProject
This is our code repository for our computer engineering capstone project. This holds some/most/all code developed for our project. 
```/app_code``` contains Swift view files, apps, components etc. for the iOS application developed for this project.
```/esp8266_code``` contains all C/C++ code for the brain box assembly. This includes sensor integration, and interfacing I2C with the ESP8266 MCU.
```/light_switch_electronics``` contains the documents used to manufacture the PCBs. This includes pick and place csv file, the BOM csv file. Additionally, it contains the schematic and layout for the switch PCB
```/lightswitch_code``` contains all the implementation code for the motor driver, communication between the switch and the brain box, and any created APIs for the app to use.
```/prototype``` contains code for the prototype of our application which was to turn a motor when requested on a locally hosted server.
```/schematics``` contains all the images and assets for the website/webpage
```/stoveknob_code``` contains all the implementation code for the stepper motor driver, communication between the knob and the brain box, and any APIs for the app to use.
